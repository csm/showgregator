Here's the idea:

1. Start with shitty venue websites that list music performances. Build up a database of venues and their websites.
2. Parse these with HTML, plus some simple smarts about how to look for the relevant information.
    * If some sites are shittier than others, add custom parsing.
3. Aggregate these into a big database.
4. Provide a clean front-end that lets you view web/iCal/RSS events, query by location, date, etc.
