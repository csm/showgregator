# Showgregator daemon

Poll internet sites, based on a configuration, and turn sites into event data.

Configuration should be CSS-like: describe a path in the DOM via elements, classes, or ids, and extract content for shows.

Fields we will look for:

* location, may be a static location (i.e., the web site of a venue)
* date and time
* performer
* links to follow (tickets link, especially)
* price

Also, ingest iCal and RSS feeds, if available.
